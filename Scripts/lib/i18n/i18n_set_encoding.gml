// As GameMaker executes your code by the encoding of the computer,
// it's necessary to set the correct encoding before drawing anything.
// This gmk was coded on a system of Simplified Chinese, so the source
// code is encoded with `gb2312`. That is to say, I have to choose
// `gb2312` to decode my gmk.

// If you're using a Japanese operating system, change `gb2312` to `shift-jis`
// If you're using a English operating system, change `gb2312` to `utf-16`
